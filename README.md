# General Labs Course

This repository contains my submissions for the General Labs course. Throughout the course, I conduct various lab experiments related to key topics in physics. The reports are written in LaTeX, and the analysis of the experiments is presented using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Topics Covered

 - **Mechanics:** Experiments exploring the principles of motion, force, and .
 - **Oscillations** and Resonance: Investigations into harmonic motion, resonance frequencies, and damped oscillations.
 - **Thermodynamics:** Studies on heat capacity, thermodynamic laws, and adiabatic conditions.
 - **Gyroscopic Motion:** Analysis of gyroscopic effects, including precession and nutation .
 - **Electro- und Magnetostatics:** Experiments focusing on electric and magnetic fields, and their interactions.
 - **Electrical Circuits:** Design, analysis, and measurement of electrical circuits, including Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s laws, and Impedance Matching.

## Files and Structure

  - Reports: Each experiment is documented in a LaTeX file with detailed explanations, theoretical background, data analysis, and conclusions.
  - Jupyter Notebooks: Code and computations for data analysis, graphs, and simulations related to the experiments.
